ðŸ“‹ Project Description
Tanzu's Creation is a JavaFX-based desktop application that allows users to manage jewelry products.
It is inspired by my real-world online jewelry business.

Users can:

Log in and Sign up

View a list of jewelry products

Add new products

Edit existing products

Delete products

Filter products by category (e.g., Rings, Necklaces, Bracelets)

The system uses MySQL database to store product and user information, and the UI is designed using JavaFX SceneBuilder.
